## üõ¢Ô∏è MongoDB Atlas Setup (Optional)

The platform works without MongoDB Atlas using local JSON storage, but for production use, MongoDB Atlas is recommended.

### Step-by-Step MongoDB Atlas Configuration

1. **Create MongoDB Account**
   - Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Create Database Cluster**
   - Click "Build a Database"
   - Choose "FREE" tier (M0 Sandbox)
   - Select your preferred cloud provider and region
   - Name your cluster (e.g., "ai-phishing-db")

3. **Configure Database Access**
   - Create a database user with username and password
   - Add your IP address to the IP Access List (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for development)

4. **Get Connection String**
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string

5. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in project root
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your MongoDB connection details
   ```

### Example .env Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```ini
# MongoDB Atlas Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://potato:<db_password>@build-a-database.5k4i357.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Build-a-Database

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-unique-secret-key-here-change-for-production
FLASK_ENV=development

# Security Settings (Generate a random 32-character string)
USER_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=your-32-character-encryption-secret

# Application Settings
DEBUG=True
PORT=8080
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Replace `<db_password>` with your actual MongoDB password
- Generate unique values for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` and `USER_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Windows Compilation Errors (NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.)**
   
   **Problem**: Error messages like "Unknown compiler(s)" or "metadata-generation-failed"
   
   **Solution A - Use Windows Requirements File (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # Use the pre-compiled Windows-compatible packages
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
   ```
   
   **Solution B - Install Build Tools**:
   ```bash
   # Download and install Microsoft C++ Build Tools from:
   # https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   
   # Then retry installation
   pip install -r requirements-local.txt
   ```
   
   **Solution C - Use Conda (Alternative)**:
   ```bash
   # Install Anaconda or Miniconda
   conda create -n phishing-detector python=3.9
   conda activate phishing-detector
   conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn tensorflow flask pymongo
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
   ```

2. **Module Not Found Error**
   ```bash
   # Ensure virtual environment is activated
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   # Upgrade pip first
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements-local.txt    # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Python Version Compatibility**
   ```bash
   # Check Python version (must be 3.8+)
   python --version
   
   # If using older Python, install newer version:
   # Windows: Download from python.org
   # macOS: brew install python@3.11
   # Linux: sudo apt install python3.11
   ```

4. **Virtual Environment Issues**
   ```bash
   # Delete and recreate virtual environment
   rm -rf venv          # Linux/macOS
   rmdir /s venv        # Windows
   
   # Create new environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate and install
   venv\Scripts\activate                    # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate                # macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt # Windows
   ```

5. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
   - Verify your connection string in `.env` file
   - Check IP address whitelist in MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Ensure database password doesn't contain special characters
   - The application automatically falls back to local JSON storage if MongoDB fails

6. **Port Already in Use (8080)**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill process using port 8080
   # Linux/macOS
   lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
   
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
   
   # Alternative: Change port in main.py
   # Edit: app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8081, debug=True)
   ```

7. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - Set executable permissions
   chmod +x main.py
   
   # Windows - Run Command Prompt as Administrator
   # Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as administrator"
   ```

8. **SSL Certificate Errors**
   ```bash
   # Update certificates
   pip install --upgrade certifi
   
   # For macOS additional step:
   /Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
   ```

9. **Memory Errors During Installation**
   ```bash
   # Install packages one by one
   pip install flask
   pip install numpy
   pip install scikit-learn
   # Continue with other packages
   
   # Or increase virtual memory on Windows
   ```

10. **Antivirus Blocking Installation**
    - Temporarily disable antivirus during installation
    - Add Python and project folder to antivirus whitelist
    - Some antivirus software blocks pip installations

### Requirements Files Compatibility

| Platform | Requirements File | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Windows** | `requirements-windows.txt` | Pre-compiled packages, avoids C++ compilation |
| **macOS** | `requirements-macos.txt` | Optimized for macOS with headless OpenCV |
| **Linux** | `requirements-linux.txt` | Works on Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, CentOS, Fedora |
| **Universal** | `requirements-local.txt` | Generic version, may require build tools |

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows Users:**
- Use `requirements-windows.txt` to avoid compilation errors
- Install Python from python.org, not Microsoft Store version
- Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation
- If you encounter NumPy compilation errors, the Windows requirements file resolves this

**macOS Users:**
- Use `requirements-macos.txt` for optimal compatibility
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Uses `opencv-python-headless` to avoid GUI dependencies

**Linux Users:**
- Use `requirements-linux.txt` for best results
