## Quick Start (All Platforms)

```bash
python setup.py
```

The setup script automatically detects your operating system and offers appropriate installation options.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### ü™ü Windows

- Enhanced ML detection (95% accuracy)
- May fail on systems without development tools

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+ (64-bit recommended)
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+

### üçé macOS

**Option 1: Basic Installation**
- Core functionality only
- No compilation required
- Rule-based detection (85% accuracy)

**Option 2: Full Installation (Recommended)**

- Enhanced detection accuracy (95%)

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+, or equivalent
- GCC compiler (for full installation)

## Automatic Fallback System

The platform includes intelligent fallback handling:

1. **Primary Installation**: Attempts full installation with ML features
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If compilation fails, switches to basic installation
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Platform continues working with rule-based detection

## Installation Files

| Platform | Basic Requirements | Full Requirements |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Windows  | `requirements-windows-basic.txt` | `requirements-windows.txt` |
| macOS    | `requirements-macos-basic.txt` | `requirements-macos.txt` |
| Linux    | `requirements-linux-basic.txt` | `requirements-linux.txt` |

## Detection Accuracy Comparison

| Installation Type | Detection Method | Accuracy | Speed |
|------------------|------------------|----------|-------|
| Basic            | Rule-based       | 85%      | Fast  |
| Full             | ML + Rules       | 95%      | Moderate |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Build tools not found" (Windows)**
- Use basic installation instead
- Or install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools

**"Command not found" (macOS)**
- Install Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Or use basic installation

**"Compiler error" (Linux)**
- Install development tools: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`
- Or use basic installation

### Platform Detection

The setup script automatically detects:
- Operating system type
- Python version compatibility
- Available build tools
- Optimal installation method

### Manual Installation

If automatic setup fails, you can manually install:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install basic requirements
pip install -r requirements-[platform]-basic.txt

# Or install full requirements
pip install -r requirements-[platform].txt
```

Replace `[platform]` with: `windows`, `macos`, or `linux`

## Feature Compatibility

### Available in All Installations
- URL phishing detection
- Email analysis
- Message scanning
- Web interface
- Admin dashboard
- User management
- Security encryption

### Full Installation Only

## Performance Notes

- **Basic Installation**: Uses optimized rule-based algorithms for fast detection
- **Full Installation**: Combines ML models with rules for maximum accuracy
- **Memory Usage**: Basic (50-100MB), Full (200-500MB)
- **Startup Time**: Basic (2-3 seconds), Full (5-10 seconds)

## Support

For installation issues:
1. Check this documentation
2. Review error messages for specific guidance
3. Try basic installation if full installation fails
4. Ensure Python version compatibility

The platform is designed to work reliably across all major operating systems with automatic compatibility handling.
