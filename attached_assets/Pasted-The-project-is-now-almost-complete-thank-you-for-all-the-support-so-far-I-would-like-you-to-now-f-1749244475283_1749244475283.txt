Clear explanation of the project and its features

Role-based access (Super Admin, Sub Admin, User)

Dashboard functionalities

MongoDB backend integration

Button features like Add, Delete, Promote, Export, etc.

‚úÖ 2. Improve Code Quality
Please review the entire codebase and:

‚ú® Clean unnecessary files, imports, and unused lines

üìå Comment every function and block so I can understand it better (I‚Äôm a fresher)

üì¶ Organize the file structure for clarity and best practices

‚úÖ Keep everything working and do not break existing functionality

‚úÖ 3. Cross-Platform Installation Guide (Local Device)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
b. ‚öôÔ∏è MongoDB Atlas Setup Instructions
Explain in simple language how to:

Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster

Get the connection string

‚úÖ 5. UI Finalization (Optional but Important)
Also, if any UI layout fixes (like colors, spacing, alignment) are still pending, please clean and finalize that too ‚Äî especially for:

Dark mode readability

Proper div layout

File upload buttons

Action buttons visibility

Thank you again! With these final changes, the project will be production-ready and very helpful for me as a beginner developer
