I'm currently testing the Phishing Detection Platform project locally and have encountered the following issues when trying to set it up on Windows. These errors may affect compatibility across all platforms. Here's a detailed breakdown:

⚙️ Target Setup Environments
We expect this project to work smoothly across the following platforms:

✅ Windows

✅ macOS

✅ Arch Linux and other Linux distributions

Please ensure platform compatibility is tested and dependencies work across all systems. Below are the current issues on Windows (others may face similar problems if not addressed properly):

1️⃣ ❌ Error During pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
Error with Pillow:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Getting requirements to build wheel ... error
KeyError: '__version__'
✅ Suggested Fix:

Use the precompiled binary wheel instead:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --only-binary :all: pillow==10.1.0
Or downgrade to a more compatible version like:

text
Copy
Edit
Pillow==9.5.0
Update the requirements-windows.txt accordingly.

2️⃣ ❌ Syntax Warning in main.py
pgsql
Copy
Edit
SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\S'
✅ Fix Suggestion:

Escape \ properly like venv\\Scripts\\activate

Or use a raw string: r'venv\Scripts\activate'

This ensures compatibility on Windows terminals.

3️⃣ ❌ Missing Dependency: numpy
vbnet
Copy
Edit
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
✅ Fix:

Add numpy to requirements-windows.txt and the main requirements.txt

text
Copy
Edit
numpy==<compatible_version>
4️⃣ ⚠️ MongoDB Atlas Connection Warning
pgsql
Copy
Edit
MongoDB Atlas connection failed: Database objects do not implement truth value testing or bool(). Please compare with None instead: database is not None
✅ Fix:
In mongodb_config.py, change:

python
Copy
Edit
if database:
To:

python
Copy
Edit
if database is not None:
This avoids boolean type-check errors in MongoDB client handling.

✅ Summary of Fixes Needed
 Ensure Pillow is installable on Windows (prefer pre-built wheel or downgrade).

 Add numpy to all requirement files.

 Fix escape sequences in main.py to avoid syntax warnings.

 Ensure all database None checks are explicit.

 Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux (esp. Arch Linux).

Let me know once these changes are applied. I’ll re-test setup and functionality across all target platforms.
