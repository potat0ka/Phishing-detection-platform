The platform is almost complete, but several crucial buttons and features are not working as intended across the Admin Dashboard. Please review and fix all of the following issues urgently:
🧾 1. Scan Log – Export Not Working

    Issue: The Export button in the Scan Log section doesn't trigger any download or response.

    ✅ Expected Fix: On click, export the scan log data as a downloadable .csv or .json file (client- or server-side).

🧾 2. Reported Content – Approve / Reject Not Working

    Issue: The Approve Selected and Reject Selected buttons are not responding or processing the selected reports.

    ✅ Expected Fix: Ensure that:

        Reports can be selected with checkboxes

        Approve/Reject actions update the report status in the DB

        The list refreshes to reflect the updated status

🧾 3. Phishing Database – Add Report / Import / Export / Refresh Not Working

    Issues:

        Add Report: Doesn't open a form or send data to the backend.

        Import: No file upload or backend logic to process file.

        Export: No download triggered.

        Refresh: Button has no effect.

    ✅ Expected Fix:

        Add Report: Open a modal form to add new entry to phishing database.

        Import: Support .csv/.json uploads and insert data into DB.

        Export: Trigger file download with phishing DB data.

        Refresh: Re-fetch latest phishing DB records from backend.

🤖 4. AI/ML Configuration & Tuning – Buttons Non-Functional

    Issue: None of the buttons — Retrain Model, Test Model, or Save Settings — are working.

    ✅ Expected Fixes:

        Retrain Model: Trigger retraining process (backend script).

        Test Model: Run test case (based on sample input or random DB entry).

        Save Settings: Save ML config (thresholds, parameters) to a config file or DB.

✅ Final Notes:

    🔁 Please ensure all buttons in Admin Panel perform real actions — not just front-end clicks.

    💾 Backend should receive the correct payload and return proper responses.

    🧹 Follow clean code practices: split into multiple files, remove unused code, and add clear comments throughout.

    🎯 This is important for learning and future scaling.

Please confirm once these features are fixed and fully functional.
