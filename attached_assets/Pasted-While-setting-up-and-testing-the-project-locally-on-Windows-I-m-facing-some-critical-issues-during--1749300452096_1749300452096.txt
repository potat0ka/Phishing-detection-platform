While setting up and testing the project locally on Windows, I'm facing some critical issues during installation and execution. Please review and help fix the following:

1️⃣ ❌ Error During pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
I'm running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
Everything installs fine until Pillow is reached:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Collecting pillow==10.1.0
  ...
  Getting requirements to build wheel ... error
  ...
  KeyError: '__version__'
✅ Workaround Suggestion:
It seems like the issue is related to building Pillow from source on Windows. Consider either:

Replacing it with a pre-built wheel version (use pip install --only-binary :all: pillow==10.1.0).

Or updating the requirements-windows.txt file to use a stable, compatible version like Pillow==9.5.0 for Windows environments.

2️⃣ ❌ Error While Running python main.py
Command used:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Log output:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\S'
✅ Fix Suggestion:

In the comment on line 18 of main.py, escape backslashes correctly like: venv\\Scripts\\activate

Or use raw strings: r'venv\Scripts\activate'

3️⃣ ❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
Despite requirements-windows.txt being installed, the app crashes due to this error:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
✅ Fix Suggestion:

Add numpy to requirements-windows.txt so it installs with the rest of the dependencies.

Also check and ensure all files are referencing packages that are listed in requirements-windows.txt.

4️⃣ ⚠️ MongoDB Connection Warning
Warning:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
MongoDB Atlas connection failed: Database objects do not implement truth value testing or bool(). Please compare with None instead: database is not None
✅ Fix Suggestion:

This seems to be a warning triggered by the connection logic in mongodb_config.py.

Please update any line like:

python
Copy
Edit
if database:
To:

python
Copy
Edit
if database is not None:
Please fix these issues to ensure:

The project is 100% cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS).

No setup blockers for local users.

All modules needed by the code (like numpy) are present in the requirements.

Let me know once done so I can test again locally.
