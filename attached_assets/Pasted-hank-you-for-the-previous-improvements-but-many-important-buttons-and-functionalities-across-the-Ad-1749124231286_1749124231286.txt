hank you for the previous improvements, but many important buttons and functionalities across the Admin Dashboard are still not working as intended. Below is a detailed list of what needs to be fixed:
📊 1. Scan Logs

    ❌ Export Button: Still not working — no download triggered.

        ✅ Fix: Export scan log data in CSV or JSON format.

🧠 2. Phishing Reports Database

    ❌ Refresh Button: Redirects back to User Management dashboard (unexpected behavior).

    ❌ Action Buttons (View Details, Edit, Mark Approved, Delete): All non-functional.

        ✅ Fix:

            Refresh should reload phishing data only.

            Action buttons should perform the correct backend operations and update the UI accordingly.

🛡️ 3. Security Tools & Access Control

    ❌ View Full History Button: No action.

    ❌ Save Settings Button: Doesn’t store any config.

    ❌ Action Buttons: Not functional.

        ✅ Fix: Make sure these buttons communicate with the backend and update the DB/config files.

⚙️ 4. System Management & Maintenance

    ❌ Back Up, Optimize, and Status Buttons: No visible response.

    ❌ Full Health Checkup Button: Does nothing.

        ✅ Fix: Ensure they execute corresponding backend scripts or show appropriate status info.

👤 5. User Profile

    ❌ Update Profile Button: Not saving changes.

    ❌ Change Password Button: No effect or validation feedback.

        ✅ Fix: Link these buttons to the correct update and password-reset endpoints.

💬 6. Support & Feedback

    ❌ All Buttons Here Are Non-Functional.

        ✅ Fix: Ensure actions like submit feedback, view support tickets, and reply are connected and working.

🔧 Additional Notes:

    🔄 Please test every button and confirm it performs the correct backend operation.

    📦 Separate logic into files/modules for clarity.

    📝 Comment the code clearly (for learning purposes).

    ✅ Ensure role-based access control still applies: Super Admin, Sub Admin, and User each with proper visibility & permissions.

Please resolve these issues as soon as possible and confirm when the system is fully functional
